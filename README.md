# AAVD Module
This module contains animated vector drawables which, thanks to AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat, can work on ALL devices API 11+

# AAVD Path Module
This module contanis animated vector drawables which at this point only work on API 21+ due to the fact that they rely on animating the path of a vector. See [this blog post by Chris Banes](https://medium.com/@chrisbanes/appcompat-v23-2-age-of-the-vectors-91cbafa87c88#.gzhzsvkrf) for more details.
